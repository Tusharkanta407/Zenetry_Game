# 🎮🌀 Zentry Awwwarded Clone – By [Mahesh D G]

A visually stunning and animated **Zentry clone** built with  
**React, GSAP, TailwindCSS, React Icons, and Locomotive Scroll.**

This is one of my most exciting and challenging projects yet!  
I built this by following the amazing tutorial from [JavaScript Mastery]( https://youtu.be/zA9r5zTllx4?si=CAaKTfpzzoPpnffy ), inspired by the original **Awwwards Site Of The Day** – Zentry.

## 🧠 What I Learned
In this project, jumping straight into code without much planning was a bit challenging,  
but I took my time, understood it patiently, and learned a lot in the process.

I’ve always wondered how high-end websites are crafted – the animations, flow, and design language.  
Now I feel one step closer to building such creative **Design-to-Dev** experiences on my own.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to **JavaScript Mastery** for the detailed and inspiring tutorial.  
This project was a vibe! 🎨✨
